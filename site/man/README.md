# RabbitMQ man Pages

## Source Files

These pages contain source files that reside in the [server repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/master/docs).
They are converted to HTML using `mandoc`:

    gmake web-manpages

## Contributions

Since these files are generated, it is important to keep them in sync with the source.
Accepting community contributions — which will always come as website pull requests —
is fine but the person who merges them is responsible for backporting all changes
to the source pages.
