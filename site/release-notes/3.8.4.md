## RabbitMQ 3.8.4-rc.1

RabbitMQ `3.8.4-rc.1` is a preview of a maintenance release. It focuses on bug fixes and usability
improvements. etcd [peer discovery](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html) plugin includes potentially breaking changes
which are covered in detail below.


### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [**requires Erlang/OTP 21.3**](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.
`22.x` series is recommended.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `21.3.x` and `22.x`.


### Compatibility Notes

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x or Later Versions

When upgrading to this release from `3.7.6` or an older version, extra care has to be taken.

Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21 or later, RabbitMQ **must be upgraded at the same time as Erlang**.
Alternatively the node can be upgraded to `3.7.18` first, then Erlang 21.x or 22.x, then to RabbitMQ 3.8.x.

#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See [3.8.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0) upgrade and compatibility notes first if upgrading from an earlier release.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

Any questions about this release, upgrades or RabbitMQ in general are welcome on the [RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users).



## Changes

### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * A node recovering a large disk backlog did not throttle its recovery activity, potentially
   using large amounts of memory at peak during recovery.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2254](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2254)

#### Enhancements

 * Reduced peak memory use of quorum queues that periodically go idle.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2272](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2272)

 * Definition import is now partially concurrent, improving CPU utilisation and reducing the amount of time
   taken to import a large definition file.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2224](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2224)

 * More peer discovery errors are retried.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1627](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1627)


### Federation Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Internal resources cleanup is now more selective on abnormal link termination. A new upstream parameter, `resource-cleanup-mode`,
   can be set to `"never"` used to prevent internal queues from being deleted by exchange federation links on termination.
   Use this when data safety is more important than protection from resource leaks. It then will be up to the operator to make
   sure such resources are periodically deleted or use a suitable [TTL](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ttl.html).

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#105](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/issues/105)

 * SNI is now enabled by default for TLS-enabled connections.

   Contributed by Carl Hörberg (CloudAMQP).

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-erlang-client#132](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-erlang-client/pull/132)


### Shovel Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Shovels are now correctly removed even when deletion commands are executed against a different node
   (not the one on which the target Shovel has been created).

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-shovel#68](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-shovel/issues/68)

#### Enhancements

 * SNI is now enabled by default for TLS-enabled connections.

   Contributed by Carl Hörberg (CloudAMQP).

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-erlang-client#132](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-erlang-client/pull/132)


### Management Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * More frequent garbage collection by stats DB cache processes in environments where HTTP API queries produced
   large data sets.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#788](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/788)

 * `rabbitmqadmin` CLI switches now take precedence over config file values. This is more typical
   for command line tools.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#804](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/804)

 * `rabbitmqadmin` binding deletion now defaults to the same property key value as binding creation.

   Contributed by Ivan Kaloyanov.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#779](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/779)

#### Bug Fixes

 * TLS settings of this plugin now supersede those of RabbitMQ core listeners. In more practical terms,
   it is now possible to use a separate set of certificate/private key pairs for management UI and
   the HTTP API.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#800](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/800)

 * Queue page failed to render with a `TypeError` when stats were disabled.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#787](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/787)

 * `rabbitmqadmin import` mangled non-ASCII characters.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#785](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/785)

 * `rabbitmqadmin`'s pretty JSON format was not compatible with Python 3.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#797](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/797)

### etcd Peer Discovery Plugin

This release effectively replaces the etcd-based peer discovery plugin with a new one which
[uses etcd v3 API](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd/issues/22) and a different API client.
etcd v2 API has been effectively deprecated and requires extra effort to enable with the latest etcd release,
so this was **treated as a medium severity bug** and ships in a patch release.

There are several new features that come with this new client. Existing already formed clusters won't have to
change anything in the short term as [peer discovery only runs during cluster formation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html#peer-discovery-how-does-it-work).
All configuration keys of the original plugin are still accepted by the plugin, and most will have
the expected or semantically similar effect.

When provisioning new clusters, etcd 3.4+ will now be required.

#### Enhancements

 * The plugin now uses an etcd v3 API client and v3 gRPC-based API. This includes using a forward-compatible API version,
   natively-provided endpoint for locking instead of reinventing one, and other improvements listed below.
   It also means that **etcd 3.4+** is now required by the plugin.

   Unless specified otherwise, all other configuration settings of the original plugin are still supported.

   `rabbitmq-autocluster`-era environment variable-based configuration of the plugin has been removed. Use the config
   file-based one instead.

   `cluster_formation.etcd.scheme` configuration key won't fail validation but will no longer have any effect.
   `cluster_formation.etcd.key_prefix` will be used but only after the hardcoded `/rabbitmq/discovery`
   and `/rabbitmq/locks` prefixes. Having a predictable key prefix is more important in this version of the etcd API.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd#22](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd/issues/22)

 * Multiple etcd endpoings now can be specified as connection candidates. Previously used endpoint configuration keys,
   `cluster_formation.etcd.host` and `cluster_formation.etcd.port`, are still supported and added to the final list of
   endpoints.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd#7](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd/issues/7)

 * Support for TLS-enabled connections to etcd.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd#24](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd/issues/24)

 * Support for [etcd authentication](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/op-guide/authentication/).

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd#6](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd/issues/6)


### LDAP Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Setting `` to `0` will force a new connection to be opened for every operation. This helps work around
   obscure issues likely caused by per-connection caching in some LDAP implementations.
   Users of this setting are expected to also use the [rabbitmq-auth-backend-cache](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-cache) plugin.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-ldap#120](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-ldap/pull/120)


### OAuth 2.0 Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * When token key ID is missing in configuration, a warning will be logged to
   make troubleshooting easier.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2#44](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2/issues/44)


## Dependency Upgrades

 * New dependency: [eetcd](https://github.com/zhongwencool/eetcd/)
 * ra was upgraded [from v1.0.8 to v1.1](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra/compare/v1.0.8...v1.1.0)
