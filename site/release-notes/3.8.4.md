## RabbitMQ 3.8.4-rc.1

RabbitMQ `3.8.4-rc.1` is a preview of a maintenance release. It focuses on bug fixes and usability
improvements. etcd [peer discovery](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html) plugin includes potentially breaking changes
which are covered in detail below.


### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [**requires Erlang/OTP 21.3**](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.
`22.x` series is recommended.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `21.3.x` and `22.x`.


### Compatibility Notes

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x or Later Versions

When upgrading to this release from `3.7.6` or an older version, extra care has to be taken.

Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21 or later, RabbitMQ **must be upgraded at the same time as Erlang**.
Alternatively the node can be upgraded to `3.7.18` first, then Erlang 21.x or 22.x, then to RabbitMQ 3.8.x.

#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See [3.8.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0) upgrade and compatibility notes first if upgrading from an earlier release.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

## Changes

### etcd Peer Discovery Plugin

This release effectively replaces the etcd-based peer discovery plugin with a new one which
[uses etcd v3 API](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd/issues/22) and a different API client.
etcd v2 API has been effectively deprecated and requires extra effort to enable with the latest etcd release,
so this was **treated as a medium severity bug** and ships in a patch release.

There are several new features that come with this new client. Existing already formed clusters won't have to
change anything in the short term as [peer discovery only runs during cluster formation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html#peer-discovery-how-does-it-work).
All configuration keys of the original plugin are still accepted by the plugin, and most will have
the expected or semantically similar effect.

When provisioning new clusters, etcd 3.4+ will now be required.

#### Enhancements

 * The plugin now uses an etcd v3 API client and v3 gRPC-based API. This includes using a forward-compatible API version,
   natively-provided endpoint for locking instead of reinventing one, and other improvements listed below.
   It also means that **etcd 3.4+** is now required by the plugin.

   Unless specified otherwise, all other configuration settings of the original plugin are still supported.

   `rabbitmq-autocluster`-era environment variable-based configuration of the plugin has been removed. Use the config
   file-based one instead.

   `cluster_formation.etcd.scheme` configuration key won't fail validation but will no longer have any effect.
   `cluster_formation.etcd.key_prefix` will be used but only after the hardcoded `/rabbitmq/discovery`
   and `/rabbitmq/locks` prefixes. Having a predictable key prefix is more important in this version of the etcd API.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd#22](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd/issues/22)

 * Multiple etcd endpoings now can be specified as connection candidates. Previously used endpoint configuration keys,
   `cluster_formation.etcd.host` and `cluster_formation.etcd.port`, are still supported and added to the final list of
   endpoints.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd#7](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd/issues/7)

 * Support for TLS-enabled connections to etcd.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd#24](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd/issues/24)

 * Support for [etcd authentication](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/op-guide/authentication/).

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd#6](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-etcd/issues/6)


## Dependency Upgrades

 * New dependency: [eetcd](https://github.com/zhongwencool/eetcd/)
 * ra was upgraded [from v1.0.8 to v1.1](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra/compare/v1.0.8...v1.1.0)
