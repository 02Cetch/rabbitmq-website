## RabbitMQ 3.8.0-beta.7

RabbitMQ `3.8.0-beta.7` is a preview of a feature release. It contains several major improvements in areas of
data safety, replication, observability, and ease of upgrades. Some highlight features are

 * [Quorum Queues](http://next.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html)
 * Built-in [Prometheus support](http://next.rabbitmq.com/prometheus.html) with a set of Grafana
 * [Feature Flags](http://next.rabbitmq.com/feature-flags.html)
 * [Single Active Consumer](http://next.rabbitmq.com/consumers.html#single-active-consumer)
 * New authentication and authorisation backend that uses OAuth 2.0 (JWT) tokens and scopes

For an overview of new features in webinary form, take a look at [What's New in RabbitMQ 3.8](https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/may-23-what-s-new-in-rabbitmq-3-8-webinar).

Several features in this release are backed by a new Raft implementation for Erlang and Elixir,
[Ra](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra/).

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 21.3](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `21.3.x` and `22.x`.


### Rolling Upgrades to 3.8

RabbitMQ 3.8.0 nodes can run alongside `3.7.17` or later `3.7.x` nodes.
No 3.8.0-specific features would be available in a mixed version cluster. Mixed versions are meant
to simplify rolling upgrades and not meant to be running for long periods of time.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades.


### Compatibility Notes

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x or Later Versions

When upgrading to this release **and upgrading Erlang to 21.x or later** at the same time, extra care has to be taken.
Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21 or later,
RabbitMQ **must be upgraded before Erlang**.

#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades
and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

#### Client Library Compatibility

Client libraries that were compatible with RabbitMQ `3.7.x` will be compatible with `3.8.0`.

## Changes

### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * [Quorum Queues](http://next.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html) built on top of the [Raft consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io/) for data safety,
   more predictable failure recovery, more efficient synchronisation of new and recovered followers, and parallel replication.

 * [Feature Flags](http://next.rabbitmq.com/feature-flags.html) allow for mixed-version clusters and safer rolling upgrades.

 * [Single Active Consumer](http://next.rabbitmq.com/consumers.html#single-active-consumer) makes it possible
   to run a set of consumers for redundancy while ensuring that only one consumer is getting deliveries.

 * New metric: dropped unroutable messages. Spotting faulty publishers and routing topology issues is now easier.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1904](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1904)

 * New metrics: [connection](https://www.rabbitmq.com/connections.html#monitoring) and [channel churn](https://www.rabbitmq.com/channels.html#monitoring).

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1723](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1723)

 * Quorum queues support redelivery tracking, which can be used by consumers to protect themselves from
   poison message redeliveries.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#502](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/502)

 * New queue overflow behaviour: `reject-publish-dlx`. It is identical to `reject-publish`
   but also dead letters rejected messages.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1443](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1443)

 * Default bindings are now explicit instead of being rows in the internal data store. That means
   that high queue churn results in significantly less binding churn, reducing lock contention on
   schema database tables, and peak schema operation latencies with it.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1721](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1721)

 * Backing queue interface now exposes a function for message deduplication. Plugins now can track duplicate messages
   in a way that makes it possible to negatively confirm duplicates back to the publisher.

#### Usability

 * Maximum message size is now configurable. The default was reduced to 128 MiB.e

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1812](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1812)


### CLI Tools

#### Enhancements

 * More user-friendly `rabbitmq-diagnostics status` output.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#340](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/340)

 * New `help` command.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#316](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/pull/316)

 * A new set of fine-grained [health check](https://www.rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html#health-checks) commands.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#292](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/292)

 * New commands that explicitly decomission nodes that host quorum queue replicas.

   GitHub issues: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#287](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/287), [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#286](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/286)

 * Feature flag status reporting.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#346](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/346)

#### Usability

 * `rabbitmq-diagnostics cipher_suites` now uses OpenSSL cipher suite format by default.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#267](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/267)


### MQTT Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Client ID tracking is now cluster-wide (state is replicated across all nodes). A majority of nodes is required
   for client connections to be accepted. This is a consequence of the neew consistency-oriented design.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-mqtt#91](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-mqtt/issues/91)


### Web STOMP Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Maximum concurrent client connection limit now defaults to "infinity" (so, there is no limit).

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-stomp#113](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-web-stomp/issues/113)


### Web MQTT Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Maximum concurrent client connection limit now defaults to "infinity" (so, there is no limit).
