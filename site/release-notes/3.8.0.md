## RabbitMQ 3.8.0-beta.7

RabbitMQ `3.8.0-beta.7` is a preview of a feature release. It contains several major improvements in areas of
data safety, replication, observability, and ease of upgrades. Some highlight features are

 * [Quorum Queues](http://next.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html)
 * Built-in [Prometheus support](http://next.rabbitmq.com/prometheus.html) with a set of Grafana
 * [Feature Flags](http://next.rabbitmq.com/feature-flags.html)
 * [Single Active Consumer](http://next.rabbitmq.com/consumers.html#single-active-consumer)

For an overview of new features in webinary form, take a look at [What's New in RabbitMQ 3.8](https://content.pivotal.io/webinars/may-23-what-s-new-in-rabbitmq-3-8-webinar).

RabbitMQ 3.8.0 nodes can run alongside `3.7.17` or later `3.7.x` nodes.
No 3.8.0-specific features would be available in a mixed version cluster. Mixed versions are meant
to simplify rolling upgrades and not meant to be running for long periods of time.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades.


### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 21.3](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `21.3.x` and `22.x`.


### Compatibility Notes

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x or Later Versions

When upgrading to this release **and upgrading Erlang to 21.x or later** at the same time, extra care has to be taken.
Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21 or later,
RabbitMQ **must be upgraded before Erlang**.

#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades
