## RabbitMQ 3.8.7

RabbitMQ `3.8.7` is a maintenance release that patches
a security vulnerability.

### RabbitMQ Adopts the Mozilla Public License 2.0

Starting with this release, core RabbitMQ server and all [tier 1 plugins](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html#plugin-tiers)
are [relicensed](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2372) under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/)
(previously used license: the Mozilla Public License 1.1).

The permissiveness of the MPL 2.0 is largely the same as of the MPL 1.1.
See the [MPL 2.0 FAQ](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/) and
[MPL 2.0 Revision and Changes FAQ](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/Revision-FAQ/) to learn more.

### Erlang 23 Compatibility

This release is [compatible](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rabbitmq-users/wlPIWz3UYHQ) with [Erlang 23](http://blog.erlang.org/OTP-23-Highlights/).

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [**requires Erlang/OTP 21.3**](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.
`22.3` or `23.0` releases are recommended.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `22.3.x`.


## Upgrade and Compatibility Notes

### Deprecations

This release removed HiPE precompilation support. HiPE has been deprecated and
mostly unmaintained since Erlang 22, and will be replaced with a JIT [in Erlang 24](http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2020-June/099645.html)
in 2021.

``` shell
rabbitmqctl hipe_compile
```

and

``` ini
hipe_compile = true
```

are both retained for backwards compatibility but they won't have any effect.


### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See [3.8.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0) upgrade and
compatibility notes first if upgrading from an earlier release.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades and
[RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x or Later Versions

When upgrading to this release from `3.7.6` or an older version, extra care has to be taken.

Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21 or later,
RabbitMQ **must be upgraded at the same time as Erlang**.

Alternatively the node can be upgraded to `3.7.18` first, then Erlang 22.x or 23.x, then RabbitMQ to most recent
3.8.x release.

## Changes Worth Mentioning

### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Addressed a Windows-specific binary planting security vulnerability that allowed for arbitrary code execution.
   The vulnerability requires the attacker to have local access and elevated privileges,
   and cannot be executed remotely.

   [CVE-2020-5419](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5419) details will be fully disclosed
   after a number of VMware products that include RabbitMQ ship a patch release.

 * In a mixed version cluster, virtual host limits were incorrectly reported for yet-to-be-upgraded nodes.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2430](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2430)


### CLI Tools

#### Bug Fixes

 * Definition export using `rabbitmqctl export_definitions` exported [optional queue arguments]() as blank.
   Export performed via the HTTP API was not affected by this problem.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2427](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2427)

 * Invoking `rabbitmqctl` (or other tools) without any arguments was inconsistent from `rabbitmqctl help`
   in line spacing.


### Federation Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Links in some environments upgraded from earlier `3.8.x` versions could run into a data coercion exception
   when connection credentials were unencrypted.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#112](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/pull/112)


### Shovel Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Shovels where the source is AMQP 1.0 endpoint now gracefully handle link detachment
   if the remote end set the `closed` attribute was set to `false`.

   Contributed by @tstorck.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0-client#56](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0-client/pull/56)

 * Removed some debug logging that was unintentionally polluting standard output even when
   debug logging was not enabled.

   Contributed by @sircinek.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0-client#54](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0-client/pull/54)


## Dependency Upgrades

 * `credentials_obfuscation` was upgraded [from 2.1.1 to 2.2.0](https://github.com/rabbitmq/credentials-obfuscation/compare/v2.1.1...v2.2.0)
