## RabbitMQ 3.8.13

RabbitMQ `3.8.13-beta.1` is a preview of a maintenance release.

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 22](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or
[Erlang 23](http://blog.erlang.org/OTP-23-Highlights/).

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `22.3.x`.


## Upgrade and Compatibility Notes

### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See [3.8.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0) upgrade and
compatibility notes first if upgrading from an earlier release series (e.g. `3.7.x`).

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades and
[RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

### Upgrading to Erlang 22.x or Later Versions

When upgrading to this release from `3.7.15` or an older version, extra care has to be taken.

Because older RabbitMQ CLI tools can be incompatible with Erlang 22+ releases,
RabbitMQ **must be upgraded at the same time as Erlang**.

Alternatively the node can be upgraded to `3.7.18` on Erlang 21.3 first,
then Erlang 22.x or 23.x, then RabbitMQ to the most recent 3.8.x release.

### Getting Help

Any questions about this release, upgrades or RabbitMQ in general are welcome on the [RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users)

## Changes Worth Mentioning

## Shovel Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Exchange federation now supports a new option, `channel_use_mode`, which allows a single
   channel to be used for all federation link activity if set to `single`:

   ``` shell
   rabbitmqctl set_parameter federation-upstream dc-2 '{"uri":"amqp://dc2.messaging.coolcorp.local:5672", "channel-use-mode": "single"}'
   ```

   This helps avoid a race condition between topology changes and message flow
   and the cost of topology operations reducing message transfer rates and increasing
   rate variability.

   The default value is `multiple`. It means that every link will use multiple channels (one for message transfer,
   one for topology changes, etc), which has been the case since rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#97.
   This is the recommended mode for most environments, and all environments with a mostly static topology.
