## RabbitMQ 3.7.15

RabbitMQ `3.7.15` is a maintenance release. It focuses on bug fixes and minor usability improvements.
This release [**requires Erlang/OTP 20.3**](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

Per the new Erlang version support policy in effect starting with January 2019,
this release [**no longer supports Erlang/OTP 19.3**](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rabbitmq-users/G4UJ9zbIYHs/qCeyjkjyCQAJ).
Make sure a [supported Erlang version](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) is used before upgrading.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `20.3.x` and `21.x`.

### Compatibility Notes

#### Minimum Required Erlang Version

This release requires Erlang/OTP 20.3 or later.

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x

When upgrading to this release **and upgrading Erlang to 21.x** at the same time, extra care has to be taken.
Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21,
RabbitMQ **must be upgraded before Erlang**.

#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See [3.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.7.0) upgrade
and compatibility notes if upgrading from an earlier release.

See the [Upgrading guide](http://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades
and [RabbitMQ change log](http://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

## Changes

### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * `rabbitmq.conf` validation errors on startup unintentionally lacked a lot of relevant details.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1985](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1985)

 * When [publisher confirms](https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html) had to send both positive and negative acknowledgements around the same time,
   it could be done in a way that would violate expectations of most client libraries.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1719](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/1719)

 * Clearing a policy with `overflow` behaviour or removing the key from it did not
   roll back the overflow behaviour to `drop-head` (the default).

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#1980](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1980)

#### Enhancements


### Management Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Enabled kernel sendfile for HTTP API documentation pages could lead to leaked file descriptors
   when those pages are accessed repeatedly (e.g. a tab is always open for weeks and weeks).
   The plugin now disables sendfile for those static files by default. It can be manually enabled
   via configuration as needed.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#6938](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/698)

 * An option to display message rates for the last 8 and 24 hours was hidden in the UI even when data
   for those time intervals was available.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#6938](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/698)


### AMQP 1.0 Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Default host specified in `amqp1_0.default_vhost` (`rabbitmq_amqp1_0.default_vhost` in classic config format)
   now takes precedence over `default_vhost` (`rabbit.default_vhost`) in the core broker.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0#86](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-amqp1.0/pull/86)



### Federation Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Queue federation now uses a more informative consumer tag value.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#66](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/issues/66)


## CLI Tools

### Bug Fixes

 * Streamling `list_*` commands could hang when encountering an error from one of the cluster nodes.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#336](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/336)

 * `rabbitmq-diagnostics cipher_suites` now provides a way to display all available (not just enabled)
   cipher suites.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#342](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/342)

### Enhancements

 * When an unsupported node name is used, CLI tools will now produce more specific error messages.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#345](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/345)

 * `rabbitmq-diagnostics erlang_version` now supports `--offline`.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#315](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/315)


### JMS Topic Exchange Plugin
