# RabbitMQ 3.9.1

RabbitMQ `3.9.1` is a maintenance release in the [`3.9.x` release series](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/tags/v3.9.x/).


### Obtaining Packages

RabbitMQ releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases), [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~rabbitmq/repos/),
and [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq).

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 23.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) and [supports Erlang 24](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/03/erlang-24-support-roadmap/).

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision modern Erlang versions.


## Upgrade and Compatibility Notes

## Upgrading to 3.9

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

If upgrading from a `3.6.x` or older [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html), first upgrade
to [`3.7.27`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.7.27) and then to this version.

RabbitMQ 3.9.0 nodes can run alongside `3.8.x` nodes. However, `3.8.16+` as well as `3.9.x` both require Erlang 23.2 or later (and support 24). `3.9.x`-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster upgrade to 3.9.0 or any other patch release in the series.

While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes is covered below. Once all nodes are upgraded to 3.9.0, these irregularities will go away.

Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended periods of time
(no more than a few hours).
