## RabbitMQ 3.7.16

RabbitMQ `3.7.16-rc.1` is a candidate of a maintenance release. It focuses on bug fixes and minor usability improvements.

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

Per the new Erlang version support policy in effect starting with January 2019,
this release [**no longer supports Erlang/OTP 19.3**](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rabbitmq-users/G4UJ9zbIYHs/qCeyjkjyCQAJ).
Make sure a [supported Erlang version](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) is used before upgrading.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `21.3.x` and `22.x`.

### Compatibility Notes

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x

When upgrading to this release **and upgrading Erlang to 21.x** at the same time, extra care has to be taken.
Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21,
RabbitMQ **must be upgraded before Erlang**.

#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See [3.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.7.0) upgrade
and compatibility notes if upgrading from an earlier release.

See the [Upgrading guide](http://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades
and [RabbitMQ change log](http://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

## Changes

### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * It is now possible to configure default worker pool size:

   ``` ini
   default_worker_pool_size = 1024
   ```

   This may be necessary in environments with a large number of queues (say, hundreds of thousands)
   to speed up queue and binding recovery on node boot. By default the size of the pool is
   computed as the number of [available runtime schedulers](https://www.rabbitmq.com/runtime.html).

   [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli#302](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-cli/issues/302)

   (tables, their properties and metadata).
