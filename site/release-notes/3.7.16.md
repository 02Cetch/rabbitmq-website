## RabbitMQ 3.7.16

RabbitMQ `3.7.16-rc.1` is a candidate of a maintenance release. It focuses on bug fixes and minor usability improvements.

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

Per the new Erlang version support policy in effect starting with January 2019,
this release [**no longer supports Erlang/OTP 19.3**](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rabbitmq-users/G4UJ9zbIYHs/qCeyjkjyCQAJ).
Make sure a [supported Erlang version](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) is used before upgrading.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `21.3.x` and `22.x`.

### Compatibility Notes

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x

When upgrading to this release **and upgrading Erlang to 21.x** at the same time, extra care has to be taken.
Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21,
RabbitMQ **must be upgraded before Erlang**.

#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See [3.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.7.0) upgrade
and compatibility notes if upgrading from an earlier release.

See the [Upgrading guide](http://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades
and [RabbitMQ change log](http://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.
