### Obtaining Packages

RabbitMQ releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases), [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~rabbitmq/repos/),
and [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq).

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 23.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) and [supports Erlang 24](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/03/erlang-24-support-roadmap/).

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision modern Erlang versions.


## Upgrade and Compatibility Notes

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades and
[RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

If upgrading from a`3.7.x` release, see [3.8.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0)
upgrade and compatibility notes first.

If upgrading from a `3.6.x` or older [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html), first upgrade

## Changes Worth Mentioning

### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * [Peer discovery](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html) no longer uses randomized delays to avoid the inherent race condition
   during [initial cluster formation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html#initial-formation-race-condition). Instead it relies on an internal
   distributed locking mechanism available in modern Erlang releases.

   While randomized startup delay was reasonably effective at ensuring only one cluster was formed even during parallel node
   startup, it by definitely assumes that with some low probability more than one node can still start as seed nodes,
   and be joined by different groups of cluster peers. The locking mechanism does not have this downside.
   Now that RabbitMQ requires Erlang 23.2, the internal locking library becomes an option for peer discovery.
   Note that etcd and Consul-based peer discovery still use those service's support for distributed locks.

   `cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.min` and `cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.max` configuration keys
   will no longer have any effect.

#### Bug Fixes

### Prometheus Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * In certain double stack (IPv4 and IPv6) environments, the plugin would start a single listener
   but register two internally. That extra non-existent listener would make `rabbitmq-diagnostics drain`
   fail as it disables all registered listeners.
