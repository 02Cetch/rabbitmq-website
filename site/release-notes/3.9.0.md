# RabbitMQ 3.9.0

## RabbitMQ 3.9.0

RabbitMQ `3.9.0` is a feature release. It contains several major improvements:

**Stream Queues**

[Stream Queues](http://next.rabbitmq.com/streams.html) are a new persistent and replicated data structure in RabbitMQ which models an append-only log with non-destructive consumer semantics. They can be used as a regular AMQP 0.9.1 queue or through a new [binary protocol plugin](http://next.rabbitmq.com/stream.html) and associated client(s).

**Optional JSON log message formatting**

[Switch from Lager to the new Erlang Logger API for logging #2861](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2861) introduces an option for structured logs through JSON formatting of log messages.

**Additionally**

- All recent changes and bugfixes from the `3.8.x` release series unless stated otherwise.

### Obtaining Packages

RabbitMQ releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases), [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~rabbitmq/repos/),
and [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq).

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 23.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later. It is worth noting that RabbitMQ [benefits substaintially from performance improvements brought about by Erlang 24](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/03/erlang-24-support-roadmap/).

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 23.3.x and 24.x.

### Rolling Upgrades to 3.9

RabbitMQ 3.9.0 nodes can run alongside `3.8.x` nodes. However, `3.8.16+` as well as `3.9.x` both require Erlang 23.2 or later (and support 24). No 3.9.0-specific features would be available in a mixed version cluster. Additionally quorum queues cannot form a quorum over mixed version so some operations may unavailable during the rolling update (though they will be restored as the upgrade completes). Also portions of the management API will provide limited responses ([#3080](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3080)). Mixed versions are meant to simplify rolling upgrades and not meant to be running for long periods of time.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades.

### Compatibility Notes

#### Upgrading to Erlang 24.x

RabbitMQ `3.8.16` and later require Erlang `23.2` and support Erlang `24`. 24 is recommended due to the performance improvements that are brought with it. Consequently it is reasonable to upgrade to `3.8.17` with Erlang 24, then upgrade to `3.9.0`.

#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

#### Client Library Compatibility

Client libraries that were compatible with RabbitMQ `3.8.x` will be compatible with `3.9.0`.
