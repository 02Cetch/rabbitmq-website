## RabbitMQ 3.9.0-beta.1

RabbitMQ `3.9.0-beta.1` is a preview of a feature release. It contains new features,
[support for Erlang 24](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/03/erlang-24-support-roadmap/),
a [RabbitMQ Kubernetes Operator](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2020/11/rabbitmq-kubernetes-operator-reaches-1-0/) developed by the RabbitMQ Core team,
and important internal changes in a number of subsystems.

It also includes all bug fixes and minor incremental improvements from the [`3.8.x` release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html)
unless stated otherwise.

## Highlights
### Streams

[Streams](http://next.rabbitmq.com/streams.html) are a new persistent and replicated data structure ("queue type") in RabbitMQ
which models an append-only log with non-destructive consumer semantics.

They can be used as a regular AMQP 0.9.1 queue or through a new [binary protocol plugin](http://next.rabbitmq.com/stream.html)
and associated client(s).

Streams enable messaging patterns that were not possible or practical before, for example,
repeatable non-destructive consumption and mass fanouts to a very large number of consumers.

### Erlang 24 Support

[Erlang 24](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/03/erlang-24-support-roadmap/) provides substantial throughput
gains for many workloads tested by the RabbitMQ core team and community members.

Erlang 24 is now used by default in the [community Docker image for RabbitMQ](https://github.com/docker-library/rabbitmq).

It also allowed RabbitMQ to replace a few external dependencies with libraries now provided
by the runtime.

### Kubernetes

[RabbitMQ Cluster Operator](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/operator-overview.html)
automates provisioning, management, and operations of RabbitMQ clusters running on Kubernetes.
It is [open source](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator) and is developed by the
RabbitMQ Core team at VMware, Inc.

This Operator is not specific to 3.9 and can be used with latest 3.8.x release series.

[Messaging Topology Operator](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/operator-overview.html#topology-operator)
makes it possible to define RabbitMQ resources (virtual hosts, users, permissions, topologies, policies, etc)
as Kubernetes objects.
This Operator is also [open source](https://github.com/rabbitmq/messaging-topology-operator) and
can be used with latest 3.8.x release series.

### Logging in JSON

[Switch from Lager to the new Erlang Logger API for logging #2861](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2861) introduces
an option for structured logging in JSON.

## Obtaining Packages

RabbitMQ releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases), [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~rabbitmq/repos/),
and [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq).

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 23.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later. Erlang 24 is recommended
as it [offers substantial throughput improvements](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/03/erlang-24-support-roadmap/) for many workloads.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains what package repositories and tools
can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 23.3.x and 24.x.

## Upgrading to 3.9

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html)
for release notes of other releases.

RabbitMQ 3.9.0 nodes can run alongside `3.8.x` nodes. However, `3.8.16+` as well as `3.9.x` both require Erlang 23.2 or later (and support 24).
No 3.9.0-specific features would be available in a mixed version cluster.

While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes is covered below.
Once all nodes are upgraded to 3.9.0, these irregularities will go away.

Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and
are not meant to be run for longer periods of time.
### Quorum Queue Declaration

In a mixed version cluster, declaration of new quorum queues will fail if executed
on a node in the version minority. For example, in a five node cluster with two nodes
running 3.8, the three 3.9 nodes are in the version majority and the remaining are in
the version minority.

Existing quorum queues will operate just like before.

### Classic Queue Metrics

HTTP API responses will provide a [limited number of metrics](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3080)
or metrics for a limited number of queues (for operations such as `GET /api/queues/{vhost}`) when operating in mixed version mode.


## Compatibility Notes

### Client Library Compatibility

Client libraries that were compatible with RabbitMQ `3.8.x` will be compatible with `3.9.0`.
### Upgrading to Erlang 24.x

RabbitMQ `3.8.16` and later require Erlang `23.2` and support Erlang `24`. 24 is recommended.
Users of versions that [do not support Erlang 23.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) should
first upgrade to the latest `3.8.x` patch release pn Erlang 23.2, then upgrade to `3.9.0` on Erlang 24.

## Changes Worth Mentioning
### Core Server
#### Enhancements

 * [Streams](http://next.rabbitmq.com/streams.html), a new durable replicated data structure that allows for repeatable (non-destructive)
   consumption. RabbitMQ 3.9 introduces a new binary protocol for working with streams. While streams can be used by AMQP 0-9-1 clients,
   in most cases it will be used via a [RabbitMQ stream binary protocol](http://next.rabbitmq.com/stream.html) client. The new protocol exposes all the operations
   specific to this queue type and is heavily optimized for them, resulting in much higher read and write throughput.

   [Java](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-stream-java-client) and [Go](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-stream-go-client) clients

 * Structural logging in JSON. Nodes can now log in JSON format.

   GitHub issue: [#2861](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2861)

 * [Peer discovery](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html) no longer uses randomized startup delay to ensure only one node starts
   as a seed one during initial (parallel) cluster formation. Instead it relies on an internal
   runtime locking library.

   GitHub issue: [#3075](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3075)

 * Classic mirrored queue replcas are now started synchronously.

   GitHub issue: [#2751](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2751)

 * `journald` notifications are now performed using a library and not an external tool (`socat`)

   GitHub issue: [#2940](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2940)

- [Some properties of the product banner can be customized](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2247)
#### Internal API and Other Changes

* Standard runtime logger is now used for logging instead of Lager, a 3rd party dependency.
  In modern Erlang versions, the module offers at least a comparable feature set and efficiency of Lager.

  Users who relied on Lager-specific configuration, e.g. custom extensions or sinks, would
  have to rebuild them on top of the standard Erlang `logger` module.

  GitHub issue: [#2861](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2861)

* Different Raft-based features now can have different defaults and settings, with more configurability coming at a later point.
  For example, client ID tracking in the MQTT plugin can use settings for lower memory footprint
  and more frequent compaction while stream and quorum queues use settings more optimal for higher throughput
  on the same node.

  GitHub issue: [#2909](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2909)

* Continuous integration of open source RabbitMQ has switched to Bazel, GitHub Actions
  and [BuildBuddy](https://buildbuddy.io), resulting in much faster and incremental test runs.

  [Bazel support for Erlang](https://github.com/rabbitmq/bazel-erlang) is a new project
  open sourced by the RabbitMQ Core team as a result.

* Process group membership now uses `pg`.

  GitHub issue: [#2850](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2850)

#### Bug Fixes

 * `powershell.exe` now can run without profile.

   GitHub issue: [#2201](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2201)

 * Queue index recovery now can continue after a forced node shutdown during recovery
   (e.g. killed)

   GitHub issue: [#3099](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3099)


### Kubernetes

#### Enhancements

 * [RabbitMQ Cluster Operator](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/operator-overview.html)
   automates provisioning, management, and operations of RabbitMQ clusters running on Kubernetes.

 * [Messaging Topology Operator](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/operator-overview.html#topology-operator)
   makes it possible to define RabbitMQ resources (virtual hosts, users, permissions, topologies, policies, etc)
   as Kubernetes objects.

 * Kubernetes [peer discovery](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html) mechanism no longer uses randomized delays to avoid the inherent race condition
   during [initial cluster formation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html#initial-formation-race-condition). Instead it relies on an internal
   distributed locking mechanism available in modern Erlang releases.

   While randomized startup delay was reasonably effective at ensuring only one cluster was formed even during parallel node
   startup, it by definitely assumes that with some low probability more than one node can still start as seed nodes,
   and be joined by different groups of cluster peers. The locking mechanism does not have this downside.
   Now that RabbitMQ requires Erlang 23.2, the internal locking library becomes an option for peer discovery.

   `cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.min` and `cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.max` configuration keys
   will no longer have any effect.

   GitHub issue: [#3075](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3075)

### AWS Peer Discovery Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * [AWS peer discovery mechanism](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html#peer-discovery-aws) now supports
   [Instance Metadata Service v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html).
   In case it is not available, requests will fall back to the original metadata service endpoint.

   The v2 endpoint offers substantial security improvements and is one of
   the [AWS best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-controls.html#ec2-8-remediation).

   GitHub issue: [#2952](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2952)

### Federation Plugin

#### Enhancements

  * Quorum queues now can be federated.

    GitHub issue: [#2804](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2804)
