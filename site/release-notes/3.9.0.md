## RabbitMQ 3.9.0

RabbitMQ `3.9.0` is a feature release. It contains new features,
[support for Erlang 24](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/03/erlang-24-support-roadmap/),
and important internal changes in a number of important subsystems.

It also includes all recent changes and bugfixes from the [`3.8.x` release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html)
unless stated otherwise.

## Highlights
### Stream Queues

[Stream Queues](http://next.rabbitmq.com/streams.html) are a new persistent and replicated data structure ("queue type") in RabbitMQ
which models an append-only log with non-destructive consumer semantics.

They can be used as a regular AMQP 0.9.1 queue or through a new [binary protocol plugin](http://next.rabbitmq.com/stream.html)
and associated client(s).

Stream queues enable messaging patterns that were not possible or practical before, for example,
repeatable non-destructive consumption and mass fanouts to a very large number of consumers.

### Erlang 24 Support

[Erlang 24](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/03/erlang-24-support-roadmap/) provides substantial throughput
gains for many workloads tested by the RabbitMQ core team and community members.

It also allowed RabbitMQ to replace a few external dependencies with libraries now provided
by the runtime.

### Logging in JSON

[Switch from Lager to the new Erlang Logger API for logging #2861](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2861) introduces an option for structured logs
through JSON formatting of log messages.

## Obtaining Packages

RabbitMQ releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases), [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~rabbitmq/repos/),
and [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq).

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 23.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later. Erlang 24 is recommended
as it [offers substantial throughput improvements](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/03/erlang-24-support-roadmap/) for many workloads.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains what package repositories and tools
can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 23.3.x and 24.x.

## Upgrading to 3.9

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

RabbitMQ 3.9.0 nodes can run alongside `3.8.x` nodes. However, `3.8.16+` as well as `3.9.x` both require Erlang 23.2 or later (and support 24).
No 3.9.0-specific features would be available in a mixed version cluster.

While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes is covered below.
Once all nodes are upgraded to 3.9.0, these irregularities will go away.

Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and
are not meant to be run for longer periods of time.
### Quorum Queue Declaration

In a mixed version cluster, declaration of new quorum queues will fail if executed
on a node in the version minority. For example, in a five node cluster with two nodes
running 3.8, the three 3.9 nodes are in the version majority and the remaining are in
the version minority.

Existing quorum queues will operate just like before.

### Classic Queue Metrics

HTTP API responses will provide a [limited number of metrics](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3080)
or metrics for a limited number of queues (for operations such as `GET /api/queues/{vhost}`) when operating in mixed version mode.


## Compatibility Notes

### Client Library Compatibility

Client libraries that were compatible with RabbitMQ `3.8.x` will be compatible with `3.9.0`.
### Upgrading to Erlang 24.x

RabbitMQ `3.8.16` and later require Erlang `23.2` and support Erlang `24`. 24 is recommended.
Users of versions that [do not support Erlang 23.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) should first upgrade to the latest `3.8.x` patch release pn Erlang 23.2,
then upgrade to `3.9.0` on Erlang 24.
